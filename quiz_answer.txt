===== Shutter Speed (to freeze or blur motion): =====

1. In this image, the basketball player appears frozen mid-air with no motion blur. To create a motion blur effect instead, what should you do to the shutter speed?

Decrease: A slower shutter speed allows more time for movement to register on the sensor, resulting in motion blur. This is often used creatively to show dynamic movement, such as in sports or dance.

2. The dog running in this photo is completely blurry. To capture it sharply next time, what should you do to the shutter speed?

Increase: A faster shutter speed reduces the time the sensor is exposed, freezing the subject's motion and resulting in a sharper, clearer image—especially for fast-moving subjects like animals.

3. The car headlights look like long light streaks. You want them to look like normal headlights instead. What should you do to the shutter speed?

Increase: Long exposures cause light streaks. To avoid that and capture headlights as they appear to the eye, a faster shutter speed should be used to limit light motion.

4. The waterfall looks smooth and misty in the photo. If you want to capture individual droplets of water instead, what should you do to the shutter speed?

Increase: Smooth, silky water is a result of a long exposure. To see crisp, detailed water droplets, increase the shutter speed to freeze their fast motion.

5. The bird in flight looks sharp, but the wings are slightly motion-blurred. To make everything perfectly still, what should you do to the shutter speed?

Increase: Wings move extremely fast during flight. A higher shutter speed is needed to freeze even those quick movements and eliminate blur.

===== ISO (light sensitivity): =====
1. You're photographing a concert indoors with dim lighting, and your images are too dark even with a wide aperture and slow shutter speed. What's the best adjustment to ISO?

Increase: In dark environments, increasing ISO helps the sensor become more sensitive to light, allowing you to capture brighter photos without needing slower shutter speeds or wider apertures.

2. You're shooting outdoors on a bright sunny day, and the photo looks washed out and overly bright. What should you do to the ISO setting?

Decrease: Too much light with a high ISO can overexpose your image. Lowering the ISO reduces sensor sensitivity, helping capture well-balanced exposures in bright light.

3. You’re taking pictures in a museum where flash photography is not allowed, and the lighting is low. What should you do to the ISO setting?

Increase: When you can’t use a flash and lighting is dim, increasing ISO helps brighten the image so details can still be seen clearly.

4. You're experimenting with night sky photography using long exposures and a tripod. What ISO would give you a cleaner result?

Decrease: Since the tripod keeps the camera steady for long exposures, you can afford to lower the ISO. This results in less noise (grain) and more detail in your final night photo.

5. Your indoor house photo looks too dark, and you don’t want to change shutter speed or aperture. What should you do to the ISO setting?

Increase: When shutter and aperture must remain unchanged, raising the ISO is your best option to brighten the image while maintaining current exposure time and depth of field.

===== Aperture (depth of field): =====
1. The background is very blurry, and only the subject is in focus. To bring more of the background into focus, what should you do to the aperture?

Decrease: A smaller aperture (higher f-number) increases the depth of field, allowing more of the scene—both foreground and background—to stay sharp.

2. In a landscape photo, the mountains in the distance are blurry. You want everything from front to back to be sharp. What should you do to the aperture?

Decrease: Using a small aperture ensures a large depth of field, which helps keep distant objects like mountains in clear focus along with the foreground.

3. The portrait looks too flat because both the subject and background are in focus. To blur the background more, what should you do to the aperture?

Increase: A larger aperture (lower f-number) reduces depth of field, helping isolate the subject by making the background beautifully blurred, adding depth and visual interest.

4. You want a shallow depth of field for a dramatic flower close-up. How should you adjust the aperture to achieve this?

Increase: A wide aperture creates a very shallow focus area, perfect for close-up shots where you want the subject sharp and the background soft and dreamy.

5. You're shooting a group photo and want everyone, from the front row to the back, to be in sharp focus. What should you do to the aperture?

Decrease: Using a smaller aperture gives you greater depth of field so that all people, no matter where they’re positioned in the group, appear in focus.
